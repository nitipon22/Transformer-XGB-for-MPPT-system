Dataset Usage and Availability

Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset used in this study is not included in this repository.
Users are required to download the "Solar Power Generation Data" dataset directly from Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data) and place it in the
appropriate data directory before running the code.

Forecast Data Description

The forecasting datasets are constructed by combining the following components:

- forecast2 = irrdataset2 + tempdataset2 
- forecast3 = irrdataset3 + tempdataset3 
p_pred3 predict from forecast2
p_pred4 predict from forecast3
where:
- irrdataset represents the solar irradiance forecasting data,
- tempdataset represents the module temperature forecasting data,
- p_pred represents the predicted DC power output generated by the corresponding model.

All preprocessing, feature construction, and forecasting steps are fully reproducible using the
provided scripts once the dataset is obtained from the original source.
